    <ul>
        <li>These are words attached to a selector that modifies the selector only under certain conditions. 
            They include: 

            <ul>
                <li><code>:hover</code> : Lays out the modifications to a selector when a mouse is hovered upon it.</li>
                <li><code>:link</code> : Controls how visited links will look like.</li>
                <li><code>:active</code> : controls how an element behaves when it is clicked.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
