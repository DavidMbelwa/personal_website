    <h4 class="low-titles">Color</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>In CSS, you can use either the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color" target="_blank">named</a> 
                colors, the hexadecimal colors and rgb colors to create a color out of a 
                mixture of red, blue and green, or use the HSL colors to create colors by controlling their hue, saturation and lightness.</li>

            <li>All colors among named colors have their respective hexadecimal and rgb values, but since the hexadecimal
                and rgb values are hard to remember, people who started this business earlier than you decided that it is wise
                to name a certain set of commonly used colors in order to avoid the hustle of trying to record each number or 
                letter that is in the hexadecimal or RGB values.
            </li>

            <li>Hecadecimal and RGB on the other hand, allow you to explore a wide range of colors, simply by changing the respective
                values of red, green, and blue. So these two options are greater for exploration.
            </li>

            <li>HSL is among the best. With it, you not only control how green, blue, or red a color is, but also how saturated (rich or pale), and 
                how light a color is.
            </li>

            <li></li>
        </ul>

        
        <h5>Hexadecimal Colors</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>These are numerical and lettered representations of the red , blue, and green combination.</li>

            <li>They operate in the hexadecimal space, which has 16 decimal points (different from the 10, 0-9, mathematical ones); 
                so the letters are used to represent the remaining 10-15 decimal points that can't be represented by numbers.
            </li>

        </ul>


        <h5>RGB Colors</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>These are like hexadecimals, except you choose the value of each of the three colors from a range of 0 to 255</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>HSL</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>As mentioned before, HSL controls the amount of hue (the color itself), saturation (strong or pale), and lightness (brightness).</li>

            <li>With it, you can play around with a particular color and see how many shades of it you can create by just adjusting its levels 
                of saturation and lightness. You can then copy the hexadecimal value of this color and use it somewhere else if you wish.
            </li>

            <li>The code is as follows: </li>

            <figure class="code-fig">
                <code class="css">
                    h1 {
                        color: hsl(240, 50%, 20%)
                    }
                </code>
            </figure>

            <li>In the code above, the hue value is represented as a value in degrees btn 0 to 360, representing the circle of colors
                in the color wheel. Red is at 0 degrees, green at 120, and blue at 240. In between you'll find purple, yellow, and others.
            </li>

            <li>The <code>50%</code> represents the value of saturation in decimal. Just play around with this to see what you come end-up 
                with. 
            </li>

            <li>The <code>20%</code> represents the value of lightness in percentage. The normal brightness of any color starts at 50%, so any
                value below or above that represents a lighter or dimmer version of the color. Play with this also to see what you can end-up
                with. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Opacity</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>Control the level of opacity in your colors by adding an "a" to the rgb() or hsl() declaration:</li>

            <figure class="code-fig">
                <code class="css">
                    .container {
                        background-color: hsla(240, 50%, 30%, 0.3)
                    }
                </code>
            </figure>

            <li>The background color of the container element in the code above will have an opacity level of 0.3. Going closer to 1 makes a color opaque 
                (less-transparent), while moving closer to 0 makes it more transparent.
            </li>
        </ul>
