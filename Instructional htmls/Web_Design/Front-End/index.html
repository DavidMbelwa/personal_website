                    <p>
                        This is the page that contains pathways to materials on front-end development. Depending on your level on the ladder, 
                        you might need or needn't the direction of which technology to tackle first on your journey as a front-end developer. 
                        If you already know what you want, go straight to the dropdowns on the left and select it. If you don't, 
                        reading the article below might be worth your while.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>In The Beginning.</h3>
                    <p>
                        For an absolute beginner, having a working knowledge of HTML and CSS is the first step on your journey. These two technologies will teach you how to put
                        information on a webpage and how to style it. Notes on this module will give you enough knowledge to start building websites, and that's what you really need. 
                        You'll discover advanced features of these two languages as you grow in your development journey. 
                        <br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>After HTML and CSS</h3>
                    <p>By the time you get the basic CSS and HTML down, you would want to add some professionalism into your site. That's when the knowledge of design theory comes to play.
                        Design theory teaches you the industry standards on how to present visual information, and you'll learn things like how to choose colors, how much space to put 
                        between your elements, which kind of fonts to use, and so on. <br><br>

                        Knowing design theory will make you a professional designer, and it will give you directions on how you should 
                        start and style your future projects according to its needs.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
                    <p>
                        After you get down the design theory, your next stop should be learning the design patterns. These are common elements used to package information on websites. They include
                        navigation panels, dropdown menus, buttons, etc. Learning them will make you even more of a professional web developer. <br><br>
                    </p>


                    <h3>Interactivity and JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        By the time you've finished exploring designs patterns, you would've already been exposed to some bits of JavaScript. Depending on where you took your materials on 
                        design patterns from, you might've also already been exposed to CSS frameworks too. If you haven't, learning CSS frameworks should be your next step. <br><br>

                        While JavaScript is essential for your next steps of web development, most CSS frameworks already come with their pre-configured JavaScript that enables you to activate the same
                        kind of functionality for your elements as the one you would have coded by yourself had you known JavaScript. And this doesn't only apply if you don't know JavaScript
                        but also even if you knew it, as coding interactivity for each and every design pattern on each of your webpage is just too much. <br><br>

                        There are many CSS frameworks out there, and whichever you use might depend on who recommended to you which one, or which one you discovered by yourself and deemed easier 
                        to learn and understand. I personally use Bootstrap, and I could advise you to start from there. It has got a good documentation, a wide array of supported components, a considerable 
                        use in the programming community, and much more. Other alternatives might be W3.CSS, Tailwind CSS, and others. <br><br>

                        The thing that will force you out of your shell will be the customizations you need to make to the CSS framework of your choice. You see, while CSS frameworks are great, they come with 
                        standard parameters for things like color, spacing, and sizing. Now, at this stage, you're a developer enough to want to put your own colors and spacing parameters for your website, and this
                        will force you to want to modify the standard parameters of your CSS framework. To be able to do this, you will need to familiarize yourself with one of the most important important tool in
                        front-end engineering: Node JS. <br><br>

                        You see, web based languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript cannot be executed natively by a computer. This is because they were written to give instructions to web browsers rather than computers.
                        Since HTML and CSS were completely made for presentation purposes rather than computational ones, no one bothered to try and read them outside the browser. But since JavaScript is by nature a computational
                        language, people tried and built a program that can read and execute JavaScript code outside the computer, hence Node JS. <br><br>

                        Node JS is a JavaScript development environment that can read and execute JavaScript code outside a browser. This might have been completely irrelevant to you at this stage, had it not been for the 
                        fact that Node JS is also the environment that most CSS frameworks can run on on your computer. Frameworks such as Bootstrap usually come
                        either as external links that you can attach to your files, or bundles that can be read and customized through Node JS, thus your need to know Node JS <br><br>

                        So, to be able to customize your CSS frameworks, you should have Node JS installed in your computer, and at least have a working knowledge of how it works. It is actually pretty straightforward
                        , and you really don't have anything to worry about. Once you have Node JS installed, you might need to learn some advanced CSS terminology, such as CSS libraries, their compilers, etc. You'll probably 
                        learn this gradually as you learn how to use your CSS framework of choice.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Beyond CSS and Its Frameworks..</h3>
                    <p>
                        By the time you're fluent with a CSS framework, you're officially a front-end developer, albeit a lousy one. By this stage, you know how to create responsive websites and how to style them professionally. 
                        You hadn't needed to learn any JavaScript, and you have just free-riden your way to responsive website design. Congratulations! <br><br>

                        The next step in your development journey is to learn to make something called: <i>Single Page Apps (SPAs)</i>. This is when you create an entire website out of a single HTML page. There's no running away from
                        learning JavaScript here. <br><br>

                        For single page apps, you'll essentially be using JavaScript frameworks to create them. Now, like for CSS frameworks, you can't really use a JavaScript framework if you don't have a basic knowledge of JavaScript, 
                        hence the need learn it. Notes in this section will help you get around what JavaScript does, but in case you need extra materials, w3schools.com is a good place to go.
