            <ul>
                <li>What is life? Any organism that can replicate itself and maintain functionality within its machinery.</li>

                <li>How did we get to life? It is complicated, but to put it simply, you need to have water, amino acids, and some fats.</li>

            <h2>What is a cell..? Definitely something you should know about.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you wanted to know what life is, you would be served well by knowing what is a cell and how it operates.</li>

                <li>A cell, or the smallest unit of life, is the smallest organism that replicates and struggles against death.</li>

                <li>How did it come to do this..? Well to replicate, it had to develop a system of encoding and replicating the information of what 
                    it is and what it needs to keep it alive.</li> 
                    
                <li>To struggle against death, it had to develop robotic processes that repeat almost indefinetly without failing, 
                    provided it has found all the requirements to keep the system going. That is a cell in a nutshell.
                </li>

                <li>How does it do these two functions? By using a set of acids. The first one is RNA, or ribonucleic acid. This one has the job of 
                    decoding the information within the cell. The second one is DNA, whose function is to store the cellular information for the next generation.
                </li>

                <li>These two acids are very important in explaining things as the origin of life for example.</li>
                    
                <li>Well... How did it learn to do this? Well, some billions of years ago, when the earth had nothing but void waters and uninhabited lands, 
                    some molecules with water loving end 
                    several chemical reactions led to the evolution of single celled organisms, 
                    commonly referred to as <em>Prokaryotes</em> by people who paid attention in biology classes.</li>

                <li>These <em>prokaryotes</em> were the first form of life that human beings know for sure.</li>

                <li>They lived by converting </li>

                <li>Why is it important? Well</li>
                <li>Any life form is made of billion of cells, divided in function such that some cells make up 
                    an arm, for example, and some cells makes an eye.
                </li>
                    
                <li>As mentioned above, the division of functions makes an organism they way it is, as the different 
                    parts of its body (made up by cells) enables it to carry out different functions required for survival

            <h2>What is a typical day inside a cell? It is a busy one!</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Imagine a cell as a factory house, with a huge hall where different workers do whatever jobs 
                    the management wants them to do, and a smaller building inside the factory house where the management resides</li>
                    
                <li>The small building is the <em>nucleus</em>, the instruction powerhouse of the cell. Inside it, there is the <em>nucleolus</em>, a smaller factory for creating
                    the management-side type of workers called <em>ribosomes.</em>.
                    </li>

                <li>Ribosomes in-turn read the instruction manuals for the creation of all other workers in the cell factory, the proteins.
                    As we'll see a little bit later, if you want to do anything in the cell you'll have to consult proteins.
                </li>

                <li>The instruction manual in question are DNAs, long chains of acidic molecules, found inside the nucleus of a cell for <em>Eukaryotic</em> cells and just floating around in <em>Prokaryotic cells</em>.
                </li>


                <li>Made out of a chain of pieces with a combination of some 4 atoms, DNA carries the instructions on how to create different proteins, the main workers in the cell industry.</li>

                <li>As mentioned above, proteins are the among the major players in the cell factory. You want to make something in the cell, you'll use proteins. You want to make Ribosomes for example, 
                    you use some 200 proteins, you want to make a skeleton of the cell, again, you use proteins. And so on.
                </li>

                <li>To make these proteins, there are 
                </li>

                <li>Outside the nucleous are generators which creates the power needed to run the cell factory. These generators are called <em>Mitochondria</em>. They do this 
                        mainly by braking sugars / fats into a chemical compound called ATP, which when released inside the cell powers other organs of the cell.
                    </li>

                <li>You can't describe the insides of a cell without talking about proteins of course. What are they? The are the robots made by the cell in order for first create the structure
                        of the cell itself, and secondly to do whatever functions of survival a cell requires to do in order to live, grow, and duplicate.
                    </li>

                <li>The robots are made by a combination of 20 acids, called amino acids, which depending on the combination, results into a variety of different protein
                        robots who can do different things within the cell.
                    </li>

                <li>Well... Who decides the combination of the amino acids? A long molecule, famously known as DNA.</li>

                <li>Wait.. What are molecules? Well, they are a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds, , having sub-units and all that, and they just float
                        around in a living, or non-living, organism, either doing a job in a living organism, or just sitting there, giving a non-living organism its characteristics.
                    </li>

                <li>These big molecules are usually called <em>Polymers</em> by people who are knowledgeable in this field.</li>
                <li>So the DNA is one such big molecule. Atoms attached therein includes one of sugar, one of phosphate, and one of the instruction; a single component </li>

            <h2>What do Cells do? Replicate, Maintain their order, Evolve, and Die.</h2>
                    
            <ul>
                <li>One of the main four fundamental actions of a cell is to replicate itself. That's the main function even. It does this by replicating its instruction manual: 
                The DNA; and then make sure there's an equal quantity of everything else inside it before essentially cutting itself into two.</li>
    
                <li>Maintaining their order involves producing the necessary proteins, enzymes and other molecules that make them able to do what they do. All this requires 
                a constant provision of energy, which they get from mainly breaking down sugars and/or fats.
