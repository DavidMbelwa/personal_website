            <ul>
                <li>All html pages for your site should be in the main repository (the base folder)</li>
                <li>If you have hidden the pages to other webpages of your site in child-folders, all links
                    from those pages should start from the child-folder itself and go back or forward. Don't forget
                    this.

                <h2>The Main Places Git Operates</h2>

                <h3>The Working Directory</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the folder in your computer where all the current files of a project are stored</li>
                    <li>The first step in any version control tracking involves identifying this folder and set</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Staging Area</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>This is only known to git itself, and it is a place where changes made are temporarly recorded
                        so that they can be latter permanently saved or discarded.
                    </li>
                    <li>Only files that have been added and that are tracked by Git can be able to be viewed in their 
                        altered state in the staging area. Apart from that, the changes made to the file aren't being tracked.
                    </li>
                    <li>Depending on where you're writing your code, staging can simply mean clicking the "Save" button in your 
                        IDE (VS Code for example), to a deliberate staging (in RStudio for example). Ask the internet concerning your
                        particular code editor.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Repository</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>This is an online copy of the working directory. Its main purpose apart from sharing your code files 
                        is to be able to display the changes made to a tracked file, both locally and remotely, so that who ever is reading/following 
                        your project understands how you've modified the project overtime.
                    </li>

                    <li>Repositories stay in online platforms such as <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">Beanstalk</a>, and <a>others</a>. 
                        GitHub is the current most popular.

                <h2>The Git Workflow</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initiate a git repository by using <code class="inline-code">git init</code></li>
                    <!-- <li>Check the status of the changes by using <code>git status</code></li> -->
                    <li>Use <code class="inline-code">git add file_name</code> to add a file to the staging area of Git.</li>
                    <li>Check the changes/differences btn the file in the staging area and the same file in the working 
                        directory by using <code class="inline-code">git diff file_name</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the changed file from the working directory to the staging area of Git. 
                        Do this by using <code>git add file_name</code>. This will basically update the content of the document
                        in the staging area. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Commit the changes made on the file by using <code>git commit -m "A short line explaining what you changed
                        (the commit message.)"</code></li>
                    <li>Use <code>git log</code> to read commit messages in chronological order and view how the project evolved overtime.</li>
                    <li><code>git status</code> is for checking which files are untracked in the repository, and which files were changed of the
                        tracked ones.</li>
                </ul>
