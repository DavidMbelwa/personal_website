            <h2>Important Tips</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>All html pages for your site should be in the main repository (the base folder)</li>
                <li>If you have hidden the pages to other webpages of your site in child-folders, all links
                    from those pages should start from the child-folder itself and go back or forward. Don't forget
                    this.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Working Directory</strong></li>

                    <h3>Main Places Where Git Operates</h3>

                    <h4>The Working Directory</h4>
                    <h4>The Staging Area</h4>
                    <h4>The Repository</h4>
                </article>

                <ul>
                    <li>Initiate a git repository by using <code>git init</code></li>
                    <!-- <li>Check the status of the changes by using <code>git status</code></li> -->
                    <li>Use <code>git add file_name</code> to add a file to the staging area of Git.</li>
                    <li>Check the changes/differences btn the file in the staging area and the same file in the working 
                        directory by using <code>git diff file_name</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the changed file from the working directory to the staging area of Git. 
                        Do this by using <code>git add file_name</code>. This will basically update the content of the document
                        in the staging area. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Commit the changes made on the file by using <code>git commit -m "A short line explaining what you changed
                        (the commit message.)</code></li>
                    <li>Use <code>git log</code> to read commit messages in chronological order and view how the project evolved overtime.</li>
                    <li><code>git status</code> is for checking which files are untracked in the repository, and which files were changed of the
                        tracked ones.</li>
                </ul>
