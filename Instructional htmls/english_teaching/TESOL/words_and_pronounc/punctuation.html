            <article id="punctuation">

                <ul>
                    <li>For young learners, this is only necessary if you're teaching them how to write composition etc, which is highly unlikely. As students of English as a second language, you'll likely be focusing on their listening, speaking, and reading skills</li>
                    <li>If the class you're teaching English has to use the language for comprehension however, this is a valuable skill to have, or in situations where the alphabet of their mother tongue and its rules of writing are different from English.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Periods(Full Stops)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used to denote the end of a sentence, or sometimes to shorten names of people, eg. <i>Mr. Mrs. Ph.D. M.D. etc.</i></li>
                    <li>Another form for using periods is with ellipses (<i>..</i>), where a part of a sentence have been intentionally left out. 
                        Eg, <i>"So, what do you think"</i> is equivalent to <i>"So.."</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>A note on Ellipses is that the sentence has to remain its original meaning even after using them.</li>
                    <li>In teaching students about fullstops, the first thing is to just explain the rule, then ask them to write their thoughts while using the fullstop and then correct any 
                        mistakes.
                    </li>
                    <li>To teach ellipses, look for taped conversation that use them and have them listen and try to find out what would've been said in completion.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Commas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I know you know how to use this, just to provide the theoretical background: It is used to tell the reader to take a pause, and it affects greatly the 
                        tone and flow of a piece of text.
                    </li>
                    <li>If for example you are teaching a composition class, you would tell the students to identify areas of their text they want to alter the flow and tone of the text
                        then put commas into them and see if they fit. The trial and error will help them master the comma at a personalized level.
                    </li>
                    <li>The comma is used to separate list items in a sentence also.</li>
                    <li>Emphasise the use of commas as an inherent component of some sentence structures such as question tags and the like. 
                        The full range of these sentence structures is in <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma/">this</a> list.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Colons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colons are used to add additional information to a sentence, to add lists, or to introduce a quote. For example:</li>

                    <div>
                    <blockquote>
                        She was too late to see the movie: her car had broken down. <br><br>

                        To renew your passport you'll need : 2 photographs, your old passport, and a self-addressed envelope. <br><br>

                        The last thing she said was: "I'll always remember you."
                    </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </ul>
                <h3>Semi-colons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Semi-colons mainly join two independent clauses that are closely related. As you know, independent clauses can stand on their own 
                        and thus usually use fullstops as their main form of punctuation.
                    </li>

                    <li>With two independent clauses that are very related, you can separate them using a semi-colon as means for <b>emphasis or providing deeper information.</b></li>

                    <li>For providing deeper information, the objective usually coincides with the colon's <i>"adding additional information"</i> and thus it might be tricky to decide whether
                        to use a colon or semi-colon. The student should know that semi-colons are used for something that will provide depth to the first phrase, while the colon will provide
                        any random extra information on the subject. Examples of semi-colon usages include:
                    </li>

                    <div>
                        <blockquote>
                            Marsha likes cats; I like cats too. <br><br>

                            She left Los Angeles; The fast-lane lifestyle of the city had worn down her spirit.
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>

                    <li>Also let the students know that when reading colons and semi-colons; both of them introduce a slightly longer pause than a comma, but a colon's pause is a little bit longer
                        than that of a semi-colon.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Apostrophies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students should've known the use of these since A1's contraction exercises and possessive pronouns' use of apostrophies.</li>

                    <li>If you have to teach their use again, you might as well repeat those two topics too.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Question and Exclamation Marks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The question mark should be a fairly easy one. Just tell them to put it at the end of a question sentence and be done with it.</li>

                    <li>The exclamation mark should be used to show excitement or any other form of heightened emotion (anger, suprise, emphasis on a command, etc.), 
                        and tell them to use one exclamation mark per emotion. One is usually enough.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Quotation Marks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teach them its use on direct quoting or surronding speech in creative writing (poems etc.).</li>

                    <li>For the latter, examples of those kinds of text might come in handy.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Hypens and Dashes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hypens are used to join two words that have different meaning in order to give rise to a new word with a specific meaning.</li>

                    <blockquote>
                        America is a first-world country.
                    </blockquote>


                    <li>Dashes on the other hand, are used only for two different purposes: 1. To show a span over time or any other aspect (the <i><b>en</b></i> dash), <br>
                        <blockquote>
                            She works 9-5 every weekday.
                        </blockquote>

                        or 2. Showing a pause in speech or thought (the <i><b>em</b></i> dash). <br>

                        <blockquote>
                            She was as quiet as an owl - as though she had seen a ghost.
                        </blockquote>
                    </li>

                    <li>Hypens and <i>en</i> dashes don't have spaces around them but the <i>em</i> dash has.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Slashes</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>They are used mostly in informal composition to replace "or".</li>

                    <li>Students should see you use them in your notes in the class.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Parantheses vs Brackets</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Parentheses are not brackets. Brackets are squared while paretheses are the ones rounded.</li>

                    <li>Paretheses are used in a wide variety of writings to give surplus information about the subject or the object
                        of the sentence.
                    </li>

                    <blockquote>
                        The meeting (which had already been postponed 2 times) was postponed again due to the coming of the prime minister in 
                        the province.
                    </blockquote>

                    <li>Brackets on the other hand, are used in technical writings to give information that clarifies the situation.</li>

                    <blockquote>
                        It was the last time their parents saw them [the missing girls].
                    </blockquote>
