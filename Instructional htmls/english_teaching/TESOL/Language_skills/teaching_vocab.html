                    <h2>Meaning, Form, and Pronounciation</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>These are things you focus on when you're teaching new vocabulary.
                        </li>

                        <li>Meaning is the first thing you teach, so there isn't much fuss there.
                        </li>

                        <li>Form is the type of the word; whether it is a noun, a verb, etc. It is crucial that your students 
                            know to differentiate different types / forms of words early on since it will help them know which 
                            words to use where.
                        </li>

                        <li>Flash cards are your best options for both meaning and form, but try to introduce some creativity
                            in teaching form so that your students are comfortable with the backbone of things. You can introduce
                            word streets to young children, where each apartment is a collection of a single type of words and students
                            are required to add tenants into them based on groups. Eg, vocabulary about family and kitchen ware resides 
                            in the "<i>Noun</i>" apartment, concrete and abstract verb in their own apartment, etc. 
                        </li>

                        <li>For Pronounciation, the huge part of the job is on you the teacher to know special sounds in English and 
                            how they're pronounced. There're things we'll look at later in the speaking section, but you need to know that 
                            you'll have to teach your students how to pronounce <i>watches</i> for example, as different as <i>leaves</i>
                            is pronounced.
                        </li>

                        <li>Understanding a standard model of pronounciation for suffixes will help a lot. It is also a standard platform
                            that your students will learn to base their pronounciations on.
                        </li>

                        <li>For teaching pronounciation, use games, role playing and reading aloud. Also, make your own pronounciations
                            as clear and as consistent as you can, because your students will largely learn from how you spell things.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2>Collocations</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>These are words that are used together in the everyday lives of native speakers.</li>

                        <p>Eg</p>

                        <div class="quote-box">
                            <blockquote>
                                - Give me a minute<br>
                                - Do your best.<br>
                                - Heavy traffic, and so on..
                            </blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <li>The only trick for mastering collocations is understanding the context of where/when they're used.
                            So teach them in that a way. 
                        </li>

                        <li>Collocations are not as important as other grammar points, and students will invent their own combination of 
                            words to describe a similar situation. Most likely, a native would understand them. So just do your best to teach them
                            the right alternatives when you hear them do that. Give them a list of common collocations and tell 
                            them to find their meaning. That'll also probably help. Or if you make it a class one day to teach different collocations and how they're used.
                        </li>

                        <li>The type of students also determines how much effort you should put on collocations. Students who are learning for academic
                            purposes may not need collocations that much compared to someone who is training in order to be able to interact with 
                            native speakers in real-life situations.
                        </li>
