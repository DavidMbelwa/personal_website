                <h1>Words and Pronounciation</h1>

                <article id="type_of_words">
                    <h2>Types of Words</h2>

                    <p>There are 9 types of words: <strong>Nouns, Verbs, 
                        Adjectives, Pronouns, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Interjections, Determiners</strong></p>

                    <h3>Nouns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are the naming words.</li>
                        <li>They're divided into Proper, Common, abstract, concrete, and collective.</li>
                        <li>You teach them by using flash cards</li>
                        <li>Provide plenty of contrast between proper and common nouns (by using vivid examples such as "Ball, cat, house" vs "Lucy, Jackie, etc"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Verbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Words that describe an action or state of an object</li>
                        <li>For students who you don't share any language with, use flash cards</li>
                        <li>When teaching the beginners, it is important to start with a simple sentence structure such as "I like to", "I want to.." since it is useful for their
                            daily life
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Adjectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Words that describe nouns</li>
                        <li>Use flash cards for students you don't share a language with.</li>
                        <li>Use colors as a starting point.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Pronouns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Words that are used to substitute nouns in a sentence.</li>
                        <li>It is difficult to teach students of another language these words as sometimes
                            other languages such as Mandarin or Turkish, the 3rd person pronouns are
                            expressed by using a single word.
                        </li>
                        <li>You can use visual aids</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Preposition</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They explain the relationship btn words (Eg. <em>In, on, under, behind, in front of,. etc</em>)</li>
                        <li>You can use your class items as aids</li>
                        <li>You can also tell your students to tell the location of their friends in relation to other things\people in the class</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Adverbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a part of speech that changes a verb or an adjective in order to explain the 
                            manner, time, extent, or place.
                        </li>
                        <li>Common words are here, there, very, so much</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Conjunctions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are words that are used to join together sentences or ideas</li>
                        <li>They're of 2 types: Coordinating and Subordinating</li>
                        <li>Coordinating are the ones that join words or phrases that have equal status in a sentence.
                            Common examples are <em>and, or, but</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>In teaching them, give students a sentence and then tell them to add to it using "and" or "or".</li>
                        <li>With subordinating conjuctions, the halves that are being joined do not have an equal status in a sentence. 
                            Common examples includes: <em>before, although, since, unless, because</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>In teaching them, ask the students why something happens and then tell them to make a sentence.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Interjections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are phrases with specific meaning, commonly caused by strong emotions. Examples can be: <em>Oh dear!, My god!, I am sorry!!, etc.</em></li>
                        <li>Best way to teach them is to tell your students to notice emotions in their classmates' faces and attach them to a word.</li>
                        <li>Another fun exercise might be to call out the word and have the students act out the emotion.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Determiners</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are words that are put in front of a noun to specify which noun is being referred to. Examples includes <em>"a", "an", "the", "that", "ten, twelve", and so on.</em></li>
                        <li>In short, in determiners, you find articles, numeral phrases, demonstrative pronouns, some relative pronouns (like <em>that</em>), and ranking phrases.</li>
                        <li>You can teach them by asking question using <em>"which"</em> or <em>"how many"</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article id="class_of_words">
                    <h2>Classes of Words</h2>

                    <p>There are two classes of words; <strong>Open</strong> and <strong>Closed</strong></p>

                    <p>Open class / Lexical class is the class containing <strong>nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and Interjections</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It is called <em>Open</em> since new words of their type can be added, and in fact are constantly being added into the vocabulary. Eg, <em>Freegan</em> is a noun 
                        that is recently added into the English vocabulary, referring to activists who live on free foods from remainings from cafeterias or restaurants as a form of recycling.</li>
                        <li>They usually carry the content of the sentence, that is why they are called <em>Lexical</em> or sometimes <em>Content</em> words.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>The <em>Closed</em> class contains <strong>Pronouns, Conjuctions, Prepositions, and Determiners</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>They're called <em>closed</em> since there is almost no chance that new words of their nature will be added onto the vocabulary in the future.</li>
                        <li>They usually create structure in the sentence, so it's not rare to hear them referred also as <em><strong>Structural</strong></em> words.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>


                <article id="teaching_verbs">
                    <h2>Teaching Verbs</h2>

                    <h3>Action Verbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can start by basic actions (<em>Play, dance, etc</em>) and end up with a game such as "<em>Simon says</em>"</li>
                        <li>As students get comfortable, introduce simple present tense and how it is used with these verbs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Stative Verbs</h3>
                    <p>These are verbs that cover thinking, feeling, owning, and sensing. Verbs of these nature are not action but rather tell the state of things. In teaching them:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Show how stative verbs can sometimes become action verbs (<em>"He looks nice"</em> vs <em>"He looks at the flowers"</em></li>
                        <li>Depending where you are in your teaching schedule, you have to show students that these verbs are not used in the continous tense.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Transitive vs Intransitive Verbs</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Teach these in at least at B1, at least explicitly.</li>
                        <li>Transitive verbs are verbs that require an object immediately after them so they can make sense, while intransitive don't.</li>
                        <li>Eg: <em>"I like"</em> is transitive: We don't understand you until you mention what you like. But <em>"She spoke."</em> can carry itself fine.</li>
                        <li>All you need to do to tell a transitive verb from an intranstive one is to see if it has a direct object after it or if it requires one.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Auxilary Verbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are used to support the main verbs in a sentence. Eg, <em>"is", "has/have", etc</em></li>
                        <li>In teaching them, tell the students first to underline all verbs in the sentence, and then see which one is main and which one is supportive.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Modal Verbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are the ones that express ability, permission or probability. They are <em>can, may, must, shall, will</em> and their participle form.</li>
                        <li>Teach them in A2 and B1 when you are teaching <strong>ability, permission, obligation, and possibility.</strong></li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Phrasal Verbs, Regular and Irregular.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your're better off teaching off these by giving students a list containing most popular verbs in both three groups.</li>
                        <li>Be careful with phrasal verbs though, they usually contain more than one meaning. Be courteous enough to include multiple meanings in your list.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>


                <artcle id="affixes">
                    <h2>Affixes</h2>

                    <p>They are letters added infront or at the back of a word to change its meaning or grammatical function. Eg, <em><strong>un</strong></em> in <em><strong>un</strong>stoppable</em>, <em>do<strong>able</strong></em>, etc.</p>

                    <p>There are 2 types of affixes: Prefixes and Suffixes. Prefixes are added to the <em>front</em> of a word while suffixes are added at the <em>back</em> of a word.</p>

                    <h3>Teaching Affixes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prefixes are easier to teach considering the fact that they have a rule that most of them follow.</li> 
                        <li>The rule is "<em><strong>il</strong></em>" goes with words that start with "<em>l</em>" like <em>illegal, illegitimate, illegible, etc.</em>, 
                            "<em><strong>ir</strong></em>" with words starting with "<em>r</em>" (<em><strong>ir</strong>regular</em>, <em><strong>ir</strong>responsible</em>, etc), and "<em><strong>im</strong></em>" with words starting with <em>"m", "b",</em> and <em>"p"</em>. Anything else can go with "<em><strong>un</strong></em>".</li>

                        <li>Suffixes are trickier since they don't follow a particular rule and they can even change the pronounciation of a word.</li>

                        <li><em>Beuty</em> for example, becomes <em>Beaut-<strong>i</strong>-ful</em>, and so on.</li>

                        <li>To teach affixes, you can:
                            <ol class="numerical_list"> 
                                <li>Start with a targeted topic, eg. Changing Adjectives to Adverbs, Negating Nouns etc.</li>
                                <li>Start with Prefixes, then suffixes.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                        <li>Techniques in teaching affixes include
                            <ul>
                                <li>Dividing students into groups, then giving each group a pile of word cards and a chart with three columns. Each group should work together to cut the words apart, into their root, suffix, and prefix, and arrange them in the appropriate columns.</li>
                                <li>Putting a number of cards face down on the table. Each card should have a word that your students know well and can be combined with a suffix or prefix that they also know. The students should then take turns to pick a card and say the word on its underside, but with an affix added. If correct, they get to keep the card or gain a point.</li>
                                <li>Introduce a specific prefix or suffix and help your students to build a "word tree" by listing all the different words which can use this affix. This can be turned into a competition by splitting the class into groups, and having them compete to crate the tree with the most correct words.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>As your students get exposed to more words with suffix and prefixes, that is how their vocabulary on that front increases.</li>
                    </ul>

                <article id="punctuation">
                    <h2>Punctuation</h2>
