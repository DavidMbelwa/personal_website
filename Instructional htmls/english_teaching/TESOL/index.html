                <h1>Words and Pronounciation</h1>

                <article id="type_of_words">
                    <h2>Types of Words</h2>

                    <p>There are 9 types of words: <strong>Nouns, Verbs, 
                        Adjectives, Pronouns, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Interjections, Determiners</strong></p>

                    <h3>Nouns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are the naming words.</li>
                        <li>They're divided into Proper, Common, abstract, concrete, and collective.</li>
                        <li>You teach them by using flash cards</li>
                        <li>Provide plenty of contrast between proper and common nouns (by using vivid examples such as "Ball, cat, house" vs "Lucy, Jackie, etc"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Verbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Words that describe an action or state of an object</li>
                        <li>For students who you don't share any language with, use flash cards</li>
                        <li>When teaching the beginners, it is important to start with a simple sentence structure such as "I like to", "I want to.." since it is useful for their
                            daily life
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Adjectives</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Words that describe nouns</li>
                        <li>Use flash cards for students you don't share a language with.</li>
                        <li>Use colors as a starting point.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Pronouns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Words that are used to substitute nouns in a sentence.</li>
                        <li>It is difficult to teach students of another language these words as sometimes
                            other languages such as Mandarin or Turkish, the 3rd person pronouns are
                            expressed by using a single word.
                        </li>
                        <li>You can use visual aids</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Preposition</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They explain the relationship btn words (Eg. <em>In, on, under, behind, in front of,. etc</em>)</li>
                        <li>You can use your class items as aids</li>
                        <li>You can also tell your students to tell the location of their friends in relation to other things\people in the class</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Adverbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a part of speech that changes a verb or an adjective in order to explain the 
                            manner, time, extent, or place.
                        </li>
                        <li>Common words are here, there, very, so much</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Conjunctions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are words that are used to join together sentences or ideas</li>
                        <li>They're of 2 types: Coordinating and Subordinating</li>
                        <li>Coordinating are the ones that join words or phrases that have equal status in a sentence.
                            Common examples are <em>and, or, but</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>In teaching them, give students a sentence and then tell them to add to it using "and" or "or".</li>
                        <li>With subordinating conjuctions, the halves that are being joined do not have an equal status in a sentence. 
                            Common examples includes: <em>before, although, since, unless, because</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>In teaching them, ask the students why something happens and then tell them to make a sentence.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Interjections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are phrases with specific meaning, commonly caused by strong emotions. Examples can be: <em>Oh dear!, My god!, I am sorry!!, etc.</em></li>
                        <li>Best way to teach them is to tell your students to notice emotions in their classmates' faces and attach them to a word.</li>
                        <li>Another fun exercise might be to call out the word and have the students act out the emotion.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Determiners</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are words that are put in front of a noun to specify which noun is being referred to. Examples includes <em>"a", "an", "the", "that", "ten, twelve", and so on.</em></li>
                        <li>In short, in determiners, you find articles, numeral phrases, demonstrative pronouns, some relative pronouns (like <em>that</em>), and ranking phrases.</li>
                        <li>You can teach them by asking question using <em>"which"</em> or <em>"how many"</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article id="class_of_words">
                    <h2>Classes of Words</h2>

                    <p>There are two classes of words; <strong>Open</strong> and <strong>Closed</strong></p>

                    <p>Open class / Lexical class is the class containing <strong>nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and Interjections</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It is called <em>Open</em> since new words of their type can be added, and in fact are constantly being added into the vocabulary. Eg, <em>Freegan</em> is a noun 
                        that is recently added into the English vocabulary, referring to activists who live on free foods from remainings from cafeterias or restaurants as a form of recycling.</li>
                        <li>They usually carry the content of the sentence, that is why they are called <em>Lexical</em> or sometimes <em>Content</em> words.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>The <em>Closed</em> class contains <strong>Pronouns, Conjuctions, Prepositions, and Determiners</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>They're called <em>closed</em> since there is almost no chance that new words of their nature will be added onto the vocabulary in the future.</li>
                        <li>They usually create structure in the sentence, so it's not rare to hear them referred also as <em><strong>Structural</strong></em> words.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>


                <article id="teaching_verbs">
                    <h2>Teaching Verbs</h2>

                    <h3>Action Verbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can start by basic actions (<em>Play, dance, etc</em>) and end up with a game such as "<em>Simon says</em>"</li>
                        <li>As students get comfortable, introduce simple present tense and how it is used with these verbs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Stative Verbs</h3>
                    <p>These are verbs that cover thinking, feeling, owning, and sensing. Verbs of these nature are not action but rather tell the state of things. In teaching them:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Show how stative verbs can sometimes become action verbs (<em>"He looks nice"</em> vs <em>"He looks at the flowers"</em></li>
                        <li>Depending where you are in your teaching schedule, you have to show students that these verbs are not used in the continous tense.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Transitive vs Intransitive Verbs</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Teach these in at least at B1, at least explicitly.</li>
                        <li>Transitive verbs are verbs that require an object immediately after them so they can make sense, while intransitive don't.</li>
                        <li>Eg: <em>"I like"</em> is transitive: We don't understand you until you mention what you like. But <em>"She spoke."</em> can carry itself fine.</li>
                        <li>All you need to do to tell a transitive verb from an intranstive one is to see if it has a direct object after it or if it requires one.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Auxilary Verbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are used to support the main verbs in a sentence. Eg, <em>"is", "has/have", etc</em></li>
                        <li>In teaching them, tell the students first to underline all verbs in the sentence, and then see which one is main and which one is supportive.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Modal Verbs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are the ones that express ability, permission or probability. They are <em>can, may, must, shall, will</em> and their participle form.</li>
                        <li>Teach them in A2 and B1 when you are teaching <strong>ability, permission, obligation, and possibility.</strong></li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Phrasal Verbs, Regular and Irregular.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your're better off teaching off these by giving students a list containing most popular verbs in both three groups.</li>
                        <li>Be careful with phrasal verbs though, they usually contain more than one meaning. Be courteous enough to include multiple meanings in your list.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>


                <artcle id="affixes">
                    <h2>Affixes</h2>

                    <p>They are letters added infront or at the back of a word to change its meaning or grammatical function. Eg, <em><strong>un</strong></em> in <em><strong>un</strong>stoppable</em>, <em>do<strong>able</strong></em>, etc.</p>

                    <p>There are 2 types of affixes: Prefixes and Suffixes. Prefixes are added to the <em>front</em> of a word while suffixes are added at the <em>back</em> of a word.</p>

                    <h3>Teaching Affixes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prefixes are easier to teach considering the fact that they have a rule that most of them follow.</li> 
                        <li>The rule is "<em><strong>il</strong></em>" goes with words that start with "<em>l</em>" like <em>illegal, illegitimate, illegible, etc.</em>, 
                            "<em><strong>ir</strong></em>" with words starting with "<em>r</em>" (<em><strong>ir</strong>regular</em>, <em><strong>ir</strong>responsible</em>, etc), and "<em><strong>im</strong></em>" with words starting with <em>"m", "b",</em> and <em>"p"</em>. Anything else can go with "<em><strong>un</strong></em>".</li>

                        <li>Suffixes are trickier since they don't follow a particular rule and they can even change the pronounciation of a word.</li>

                        <li><em>Beuty</em> for example, becomes <em>Beaut-<strong>i</strong>-ful</em>, and so on.</li>

                        <li>To teach affixes, you can:
                            <ol class="numerical_list"> 
                                <li>Start with a targeted topic, eg. Changing Adjectives to Adverbs, Negating Nouns etc.</li>
                                <li>Start with Prefixes, then suffixes.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                        <li>Techniques in teaching affixes include
                            <ul>
                                <li>Dividing students into groups, then giving each group a pile of word cards and a chart with three columns. Each group should work together to cut the words apart, into their root, suffix, and prefix, and arrange them in the appropriate columns.</li>
                                <li>Putting a number of cards face down on the table. Each card should have a word that your students know well and can be combined with a suffix or prefix that they also know. The students should then take turns to pick a card and say the word on its underside, but with an affix added. If correct, they get to keep the card or gain a point.</li>
                                <li>Introduce a specific prefix or suffix and help your students to build a "word tree" by listing all the different words which can use this affix. This can be turned into a competition by splitting the class into groups, and having them compete to crate the tree with the most correct words.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>As your students get exposed to more words with suffix and prefixes, that is how their vocabulary on that front increases.</li>
                    </ul>

                <article id="punctuation">
                    <h2>Punctuation</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>For young learners, this is only necessary if you're teaching them how to write composition etc, which is highly unlikely. As students of English as a second language, you'll likely be focusing on their listening, speaking, and reading skills</li>
                        <li>If the class you're teaching English has to use the language for comprehension however, this is a valuable skill to have, or in situations where the alphabet of their mother tongue and its rules of writing are different from English.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Periods(Full Stops)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used to denote the end of a sentence, or sometimes to shorten names of people, eg. <i>Mr. Mrs. Ph.D. M.D. etc.</i></li>
                        <li>Another form for using periods is with ellipses (<i>..</i>), where a part of a sentence have been intentionally left out. 
                            Eg, <i>"So, what do you think"</i> is equivalent to <i>"So.."</i>
                        </li>
                        <li>A note on Ellipses is that the sentence has to remain its original meaning even after using them.</li>
                        <li>In teaching students about fullstops, the first thing is to just explain the rule, then ask them to write their thoughts while using the fullstop and then correct any 
                            mistakes.
                        </li>
                        <li>To teach ellipses, look for taped conversation that use them and have them listen and try to find out what would've been said in completion.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Commas</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I know you know how to use this, just to provide the theoretical background: It is used to tell the reader to take a pause, and it affects greatly the 
                            tone and flow of a piece of text.
                        </li>
                        <li>If for example you are teaching a composition class, you would tell the students to identify areas of their text they want to alter the flow and tone of the text
                            then put commas into them and see if they fit. The trial and error will help them master the comma at a personalized level.
                        </li>
                        <li>The comma is used to separate list items in a sentence also.</li>
                        <li>Emphasise the use of commas as an inherent component of some sentence structures such as question tags and the like. 
                            The full range of these sentence structures is in <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma/">this</a> list.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Colons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Colons are used to add additional information to a sentence, to add lists, or to introduce a quote. For example:</li>

                        <div>
                        <blockquote>
                            She was too late to see the movie: her car had broken down. <br><br>

                            To renew your passport you'll need : 2 photographs, your old passport, and a self-addressed envelope. <br><br>

                            The last thing she said was: "I'll always remember you."
                        </blockquote>
                        </div>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Semi-colons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Semi-colons mainly join two independent clauses that are closely related. As you know, independent clauses can stand on their own 
                            and thus usually use fullstops as their main form of punctuation.
                        </li>

                        <li>With two independent clauses that are very related, you can separate them using a semi-colon as means for <b>emphasis or providing deeper information.</b></li>

                        <li>For providing deeper information, the objective usually coincides with the colon's <i>"adding additional information"</i> and thus it might be tricky to decide whether
                            to use a colon or semi-colon. The student should know that semi-colons are used for something that will provide depth to the first phrase, while the colon will provide
                            any random extra information on the subject. Examples of semi-colon usages include:
                        </li>

                        <div>
                            <blockquote>
                                Marsha likes cats; I like cats too. <br><br>

                                She left Los Angeles; The fast-lane lifestyle of the city had worn down her spirit.
                            </blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <li>Also let the students know that when reading colons and semi-colons; both of them introduce a slightly longer pause than a comma, but a colon's pause is a little bit longer
                            than that of a semi-colon.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Apostrophies</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students should've known the use of these since A1's contraction exercises and possessive pronouns' use of apostrophies.</li>

                        <li>If you have to teach their use again, you might as well repeat those two topics too.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Question and Exclamation Marks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The question mark should be a fairly easy one. Just tell them to put it at the end of a question sentence and be done with it.</li>

                        <li>The exclamation mark should be used to show excitement or any other form of heightened emotion (anger, suprise, emphasis on a command, etc.), 
                            and tell them to use one exclamation mark per emotion. One is usually enough.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Quotation Marks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teach them its use on direct quoting or surronding speech in creative writing (poems etc.).</li>

                        <li>For the latter, examples of those kinds of text might come in handy.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Hypens and Dashes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hypens are used to join two words that have different meaning in order to give rise to a new word with a specific meaning.</li>

                        <blockquote>
                            America is a first-world country.
                        </blockquote>


                        <li>Dashes on the other hand, are used only for two different purposes: 1. To show a span over time or any other aspect (the <i><b>en</b></i> dash), <br>
                            <blockquote>
                                She works 9-5 every weekday.
                            </blockquote>

                            or 2. Showing a pause in speech or thought (the <i><b>em</b></i> dash). <br>

                            <blockquote>
                                She was as quiet as an owl - as though she had seen a ghost.
                            </blockquote>
                        </li>

                        <li>Hypens and <i>en</i> dashes don't have spaces around them but the <i>em</i> dash has.</li>
