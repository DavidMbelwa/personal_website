                <h2>The Structure of An Atom</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>An atom is made up three particles: Electrons, Protons, and Neutrons.</li>

                    <li>Protons (positively charged), and neutrons(not charged) make up the core of an atom; the <i>nucleus</i>.
                        Electrons(negatively charged) creates a force field, similar to a cloud, around an atom's nucleus.
                    </li>

                    <li>The question comes: How is it that it is the Protons and Neutrons that are held together tightly in the nucleus
                        while electrically speaking, they shouldn't be able to do so? At least that tightly? Well, the force that holds them together is not
                        electromagnetism and it is 10,000 times stronger than electromagnetism at a that scale. This is why atoms with 
                        more than 1 proton (some of them have more than 100) are able to exist, since although electromagnetism of the positively
                        charged protons should repel them away from each other, this <i>strong force</i> (that is its literal name) keeps them
                        binded together with neutrons. This is more important to a quantum physicist than to a chemist though.
                    </li>

                    <li>To extend that topic a little bit more, another question will be: What gives an atom its positive charge and a nuetron its non-charge?
                        Again, a question better answered by a quantum nuclear mechanist, but to stump the curiosity away: quantum nuclear
                        mechanists believe that protons and neutrons are made up by similar particles called quarks. Quarks are of the opposite nature, with 
                        a proton having 2 <i>up</i> quarks and 1 <i>down</i> quark while the neutron has two <i>down</i> quarks and a single <i>up</i> quark.
                        This difference is what gives different charges to the two particles. For more information visit <a href="">this</a> video.
                    </li>

                    <li>Back to the atom: the nucleus takes all the mass of an atom while electrons make most of its volume. The diameter of a nucleus 
                        of an atom is a hundred thousandths smaller than that of an atom itself (10<sup>-15</sup> vs 10<sup>-10</sup>).
                    </li>

                    <li>Each proton in an atom attracts one negatively charge electron such that, in a default state, any atom has an equal number of protons 
                        as that of electrons. This default state is called <i><b>the ground state</b></i>.
                    </li>


                    <li>The number of neutrons can vary though, even if the atoms are of the same element. This gives rise to <i><b>isotopes</b></i>; atoms 
                        of the same nature which have a different number of neutrons.
                    </li>

                    <li>Most isotopes are radioactive, that is they decay with a passage of time, but some decay faster (in less than a second) and some way slower
                        (5876 years).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>A chemical element is a way to tell one type of atom from another.</li>

                    <li>Some atoms for example, have 2 protons, some have 3, and some have 100. This difference in the number of protons causes
                        these atoms to behave differently and thus give rise to different types of matter.
                        So, the presence of atoms with a different number of protons leads to the development of different chemical 
                        elements with different behaviours under different circumstances.
                    </li>

                    <li>Atoms from metallic objects for example, conduct heat and electricity easily in a solid state than atoms of non-metalic 
                        objects.
                    </li>

                    
                    <li>Up to the writing of these notes, there are 119 known elements, with new ones continuing to be created or discovered.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>People bother creating new elements because they enable them to create different forms of matter or do something with it 
                        that is either economically or politically valuable. Refer to <a href="https://youtu.be/gGTEDH0SIdA">this</a> and 
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/Y9D1XQdIaLw">this</a> video on the topic.
                    </li>

                    <li>Most of these newly created elements are unstable (radioactive), meaning they loose their protons and turn into other elements
                        with time.
                    </li>

                    <li>The decaying process is faster for some elements that others (from a millionth of a millisecond to billions of years). The end product is either
                        a stable atom of a new element or a further decaying atom. You can read more about it

                <h2>The Periodic Table</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is a table containing all of the current known chemical elements.</li>

                    <li>Like you have probably guessed, new elements keep being added to it, so a periodic table 
                        as it is now will likely have more elements added to it in the future.
                    </li>

                    <li>Its usefulness is that it tells you which element is it, how many protons does it have, 
                        and even help you know whether an element is metallic, non-metalic, semi-metal, a solid, 
                        gas, or liquid.
                    </li>
