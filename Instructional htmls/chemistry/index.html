            <p>Chem is a science based on measurements. Because of that, below are core measurements you should know:</p>

                <li>In Chemistry, or the other natural sciences, these measurements are usually scaled positively 
                    or negatively to describe the micro and the macro world.
                </li>

                <li>To explain something as thin as a strand of hair for example, lenght / width has to be measured at 1 millionths of a meter,
                    causing this measurement to be named a macrometer for example, a different name from the base name. Below are some of the suffixes used 
                    to indicate scale in measurement:

            <ul>
                <li>You'll perhaps need to know the equivalents of these measurements as they are used by English speakers.</li>

                <li>A teaspoon, for example, is equal to approximately 5 mililiters (4.93 cm<sup>3</sup>). There are 
                    almost 6 teaspoons in an ounce (29.57 mililiters(cm<sup>3</sup>)). A galon is 3.785 liters (4 quarts: 1 liter is 
                    a little bit more than a quart (1qt = 0.9464L)) and so on.</li>

                <li>Similarly for lengths; 1 mile = 1.6km, a millimeter the width of a paper clip's wire, etc.</li>
            </ul>

        <article class="the_followings col-12" id="terms">
            <h2>Important Terms</h2>

            <h3>Matter</h3>

            <p>Matter is everything that has mass and occupies space.</p>
            

            <h3>Mass</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Refers to the quantity of matter in an object. It is measured by gram as the base unit.</li>

                <li>Although people use weight to refer to mass, and even use mass's unit of measurement, weight is not mass. 
                    Weight is rather the force that results when mass reacts to the gravitational force. Weight is measured by
                    units of Newton.
                </li>

                <li>Going further from the earth, for example, reduces the weight of an object, 
                    but its mass stays the same.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Temperature</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refers to how fast particles in an object can move.</li>

                <li>Absolute temperature is measured by <i>Kelvin</i>.</li>

                <li>Celcius (<sup>o</sup>C) and Fahrenheit (<sup>o</sup>F) can do the job, but their scales are not absolute, meaning 
                    at 0 celcius or fahrenheit, particles inside an object can still move while at 0 kelvin they cant. That way Kelvin wins. 
                </li>

                <li>So, 1 kelvin = 273.15 + <sup>o</sup>C, or ((<sup>o</sup>F - 32) / .8) + 273</li>
            </ul>

            
            <h3>Precision vs Accuracy</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Precision refers to how close two measurements are to each other, while accuracy refers to
                    how close a measurement is to the true value of the measured object's measurement.
                </li>

                <li>Take an example of a 1.3 meter table for example. If you gave two different students a measuring tape and they measured 
                    it as 1m and 1.5m respectively, precision is the &#177 5 difference between the measurements, while the inaccuracy is &#177 0.2.
                    between their measurements and the true value of the table.
                </li>

                <li>There is a trick that scientists use to convey the degree of accuracy in their measurements, and that is by using the last digit
                    as the margin of error by 1 degree.
                </li>

                <li>For example, if a chemist reports a volume of water to be 8.74 mililiters from a certain test tube, they mean that the volume is anywhere
                    between 8.73 or 8.75 (8.74 &#177 1).
                </li>

                <li>Similarly for base ten measurements, a 2.84 x 10<sup>4</sup> measurement for example, means (2.84 &#177 1) x 10<sup>4</sup></li>

                <li>Consider another example: You have five students who have measured a certain bench, and their measurements came down to 61.94cm, 62.01cm
                    , 62.12cm, 61.98cm, and 62.10cm. The average of these measurements is 62.03cm, but under close inspection, the imprecision btn them is on both
                    the first and last decimal digit. How will you report the average value? By making the first decimal place that is unprecise the degree of error; 
                    that is, your measurement will be <b>62.0</b>cm. This way, anybody can vary the decimal point and arrive somewhere near where the orignial measurements
                    fell.
                </li>

                <li>Now a pop quiz: You've four people who have been tasked with the task of measuring the mass of a dime. The values they reported are: 
                    2.302 g, 2.294 g, 2.312 g, and 2.296g. The average of these values is 2.301 g. How will you report the average?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Miniscus</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>This refers to the inside curved surface of water in a test tube.</li>

                <li>Water tends to climb  up the sides of glass a bit, causing the length of its volume at the sides and the middle 
                    to be a little bit different. Chemists use the volume of the water at the middle rather than at the sides, for accuracy purposes,
                    and this middle ground has been named miniscus. You'll need to remember this.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>The Scientific Process</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Starts with an observation that leads to a scientific question.</li>
                <li>Then initial collection of data on the observed phenomenon takes place (SOMETIMES SKIPPED).</li>
                <li>Then hypothesis formulation proceeds.</li>
                <li>Then a more systematic experimentation and collection of data commences.</li>
                <li>Then results are obtained and published so that other scientists can replicate the process and see if they arrive at the same results.</li>
                <li>If indeed they do, the hypothesis is accepted by the scientific community and used as a basis for the following scientific applications.</li>
            </ol>
