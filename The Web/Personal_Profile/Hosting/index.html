            <h1>Introduction To Hosting</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>You can host your site through <em>website builders, shared-hosting, dedicated hosting</em>, and <em>cloud hosting.</em></li>

                <li>The first 3 methods are not important for the purpose of this tutorial. The fourth one is the one I'll focus on.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Static Websites On The Cloud</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Static websites are the kinds of websites whose content isn't changed automatically by using a coded process
                    or by user interaction. They are the kinds in which the user doesn't participate in content creation in any form.</li>

                <li>Dynamic web pages on the other hand, are web sites that can update their own content based on a coded procedure or user
                    interaction. Say you have a weather forecast element in your website. That element being there means that the website 
                    regularly updates itself by using a coded procedure that fetches new weather data every once in a while, hence 
                    the dynamicism.
                </li>

                <li>You can host static websites by using GitHub pages, one of the simplest ways to do it online.
                    It might look intimidating at the beginning, but once you wrap your head around everything, you should be
                    good to go. Follow instructions <a href="https://youtu.be/o5g-lUuFgpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

                <li>An even better way is to use cloud computing services, such as Mi</li>
